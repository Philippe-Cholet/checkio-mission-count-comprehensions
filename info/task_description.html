<p style="text-align: justify;">
    You have to write a function that receives a python source code,
    count list/set/dict/generator comprehensions, and returns these counts.
    <br>
    List comprehensions, set comprehensions, dict comprehensions, generator expressions
    are respectively represented by "ListComp", "SetComp", "DictComp", "GeneratorExp"
    in the results dictionary.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> A string.
    <br>
    <strong>Output:</strong> A dict with strings as keys and integers as values.
</p>

<br>

<div class="for_info_only">
    <strong>Examples:</strong>
    <br><br>
    <pre class="brush: python">
count_comprehensions('[n ** 2 for n in range(5)]') == {'ListComp': 1}
count_comprehensions('list(n ** 2 for n in range(5))') == {'GeneratorExp': 1}
count_comprehensions('''\
limit = 100
assert all(
    sum(n ** 3 for n in range(N)) == (N * (N - 1) // 2) ** 2
    for N in range(1, limit)
)
''') == {'GeneratorExp': 2}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Python codes are valid (no syntax error) but do not necessarily
    comply to PEP8 rules or any implicit rule you may think of.
